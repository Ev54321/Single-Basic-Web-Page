    <h1>The Immigrant Story of Xiao Ling</h1>
    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Xiao Ling was born in China in 1792. He was born on a farm in a small village where he would work with his father and mother all day. His village would get raided oftenly, killing the village people and taking there foods and goods.</p>
    <p>When Xiao turned 15 his parents decided it was too much so they moved to America. Unfortunatly they were unable to bring Xiao along with them, so they left him all their belongings so that he could either sell it off for money or remember them as time passed.</p>
    <p>Left by his parents Xiao decided to work extra hard to see his family again. He worked the farm alone for 6 more years before finally making a choice that would change his life forever.</p>
