    <p>Xiao Ling was born in China in 1942. He was born on a farm in a small village where he would work with his father and mother all day. His village would get raided oftenly, killing the village people and taking there foods and goods. The village people would do everything they could to fight back but their efforts were in vein. When Xiao turned 15 his parents decided it was too much so they moved to America. Unfortunatly they were unable to bring Xiao along with them, so they left him all their belongings so that he could either sell it off for money or remember them as time passed.</p>
    <p>Left by his parents Xiao decided to work extra hard to see his family again. He worked the farm alone for 6 more years before he got a message that would change his life forever. On Xiao's 21st birthday he got a gift from his parents who were still in America. The gift was some money along with a note telling him how their life in America was. The note read "Xiao, Life in America is going great the people are surprisingly welcoming to newcomers and the food is amazing. Your father was able to get a good job allowing us to get a nice, cozy house. We are sending you money and hoping that you are doing well. stay safe and come to America if you can. We will be waiting."</p>
    <p>After reading this message Xiao was in a predicament and had to decide on whether he should go to America and reunite with his family, leaving his friends and the village behind or forget about America and stay with the village people. After a long day of work he got time to think of his decision. Finally as night came he made up his mind.</p>
